## About

FUCK that's a Map is an unofficial resource for fans of food and Action Bronson! I'm creating an in depth API for all the restaurants that Bron and his crew visited on the show "FUCK that's Delicious".

I'm utilizing the Google Maps API, with a React/TypeScript frontend, and a Ruby on Rails backend.

## Project Status
- Project is: _under construction!_.
